									<h2>Why Farmer's Markets?</h2>
									<p> 
									    With today's advancements in technology, farms across the country are starting
									    to mass produce and process a majority of the foods that you see in your supermarkets
									    and grocery stores. Now, globalization and industrialization isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is the fact that it endorses
								            a monopoly and control of the direct sources that our food can come from. 
									    The local farmers nowadays have trouble staying competitive against the rapid
									    and massive production that larger companies offer. By buying directly from these farmers,
									    they can pocket more of the money and you recieve a much healthier and carefully nurtured product.
								            Help support freedom of choice and your local community by visiting the Farmer's Markets that are near you!

									<h2>The Farmers</h2>
									<p> 
									    Local farmers toil day in and day out because each harvest matters. If a crop withered, so does the farmer's income. 
										The margin of error for a local farmer is much thinner than for bigger industrial owned farms. These farms mass produce 
										at a rate that is exponentially faster than its counterparts. The distribution process is much better for these factory-like 
										farms because most of the time these farms are owned by a distributor in the first place. There is no deal or split that needs to be 
										negotiated at the cost of its farmers, whereas the local farmers must give up a cut of their revenue to pay for distribution. Often times 
										these deals are financed at a very high rate and can cripple a small farm's growth. Therefore, support your local farmers by skipping the 
										distributors and paying directly for their amazing produce!

									<h2>Environment</h2>
									<p> 
									    Local Farmers don't use as many harmful chemicals or additives in the growing practice as well. The frequent use of these chemicals (often found in big
										 industrial farms) can cause land degradation, water pollution, and overirrigation that can be detrimental to the planet. 
										Additionally, these factors can end up personally affecting you once government assistance is required, as these programs are often directly funded 
										by the taxes that you pay! Stop supporting the use of chemicals that harm the environment and instead visit your local farmer's market!

									<h2>Price</h2>
									<p> 
									    Yes, these organic and delicious fruits come at a price, a higher one that is. These products are often more expensive than the ones you see in your 
										everyday Ralph’s because they are produced at a slower rate and the farmers need to sell at the highest 
										price possible to make revenue. If you are struggling financially, you don’t have to blow away all your money at the farmer’s market. 
										Just remember that the farmer’s market is an option if you are looking to pay a little bit more for a healthier product.
